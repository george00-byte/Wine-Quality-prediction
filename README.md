<h1>Project Name: Wine Quality Prediction<h1>
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains information on different red and white wine samples.

Technologies Used
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
Dataset
The Wine Quality Dataset contains 11 input variables and 1 output variable, which is the quality of the wine on a scale of 1 to 10. The dataset is openly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be accessed here.

Installation and Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib).
Open the Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.
Project Description
The project consists of the following steps:

Importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
Performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset
Preprocessing the data by handling missing values and scaling the numerical features
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Applying various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector regression, to predict the quality of wine based on the given chemical properties
Evaluating the performance of each algorithm using various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination
Optimizing the hyperparameters of the best performing algorithm to improve the model's performance
Summarizing the results and providing insights on how the findings could be used to improve the quality of wine production.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of wine based on chemical properties. The findings could be used to improve the quality of wine production by identifying the most important chemical properties that affect wine quality.
